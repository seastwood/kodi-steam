"""Reading the output of a command that says something not in ASCII.

This crashed a console the first time somebody installed Steam on it. `sh`
ran `wmctrl -lG` to find the window to bring forward, subprocess decoded the
output with text=True, and text=True means "the locale's encoding" -- which
inside Kodi is ASCII. The window list had one title with a non-breaking space
in it, and the add-on went down with

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2

after installing Steam successfully. Nothing about the failure said anything
about text encodings; it read as the add-on being broken.

Window titles are somebody else's text -- a game's, a launcher's, whatever is
open -- so they are exactly the input this cannot afford to be strict about.
UTF-8 with errors="replace": a title we cannot read should cost us that title,
not the launcher.

This drives the real function with a real subprocess and a real non-ASCII
byte, under a C locale, which is the machine that broke.

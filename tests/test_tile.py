"""The tile this add-on shows before its application is installed.

The real icon belongs to whoever makes the application and is not
redistributed here; it is copied off this machine once that application exists,
which is the same rule the console follows for box art and console logos. So
there is a gap -- between installing the add-on and installing the
application -- where the menu shows something of ours, and on a machine
installed ten minutes ago that gap is the whole of what anybody sees.

It got there by being wrong. The tile shipped for Steam was a speedometer,
which means nothing to anybody looking for Steam, and it was noticed on the
console only because Steam had been installed and Valve's own icon had quietly
replaced it. A fresh install put it straight back.

So this holds the tile to the set it sits in: 256 square, two colours and
transparency, the same disc and ring as every other icon on that menu. And it
holds the file to the generator that claims to draw it, because a PNG nobody
can regenerate is a PNG nobody can correct.
